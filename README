NAME
    Console - Console Interfaces and Base Implementations

SYNOPSIS
    Use Console::ReadLineIF as is:

      use Console::ReadlineIF;   # Interface
      use Console::TermReadLine; # An implementation

      my $console_if = Console::TermReadLine->New();
      my $user_str = $console_if->readline('prompt >');
      print "returned: '$user_str'\n";

DESCRIPTION
    This interface module abstracts console management operations.
    Ref to interfaces defined in:
    - Console/ReadLineIF.pm: interface for readline with prompt

EXAMPLES
    See SYNOPSYS above.

TO DO
    Some work to be done:
    - Abstract Console In()/Out() in a bare Console/InOutStreamIF Interface
    - Complement with stream operators such as Pipe(), Tee(), Merge()
    - add more examples to this README
    - Generate the README from Console/Console.pm POD
    - find a namespace and publish to CPAN
